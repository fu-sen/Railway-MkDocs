## Vercel-MkDocs

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/new/template/DDlS-S?referralCode=weEGSc)

**MkDocs with Railway (minimal configuration)**

- [Railway](https://railway.app/)
- [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)

## How to use

1. Edit `mkdocs.yml` and `docs/index.md`, add more files if needed.
2. Add the pip package to `requirements.txt` . (Themes and plugins)
3. Commit to a GitHub project: `git push`
4. Select **New - GitHub Repo** from Railway and select your project.
6. Wait a moment. The URL will be displayed when the deployment is complete.

## Build error

Many of the build error are that you mistyped `mkdocs.yml`
or you forgot to add the package to` requirements.txt`.
Check the file change immediately before the error occurred.

This is often not a problem with this project.
You should not open an issue for that.

## Fork of this project

If you fork this project, be sure to change something and commit.
If you re-deploy without changing anything, it's my commit and I'll be notified.

You can also create a new project without forking or use the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) without creating a project.
